## Lighthouse

> Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of
web pages. You can run it against any web page, public or requiring
authentication. It has audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web
apps, SEO, and more.

It is available as an add-on tool for Google Chrome and Firefox and it can be
run from the command line. That is useful for testing on a local development
environment.
